# BL-Reservoir
BL Reservoir is a repository of tools we've developed to search through our data in new and different ways. Algorithms developed will be packaged into a docker image, 
and made avaliable for execution on cloud GCP's cloud computing platform to scale SETI searches. To trigger the execution of various algorithms, BL@Scale facilitates the scaling of such products.
